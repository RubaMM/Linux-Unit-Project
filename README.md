# File Encryption/Decryption Project

## Overview
#### A Bash script that you can use to Encrypt and Decrypt the files using The Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)-256 Algorithm which is a symmetric encryption algorithm that requires a key to encrypt and decrypt . 

## User Stories 
#### Basic Encryption and Decryption:
- As a user, I want to encrypt files containing sensitive information to protect them from unauthorized access.
- As a user, I want to decrypt files that have been previously encrypted, so I can access their contents when needed.
#### File Selection and Path Control:
- As a user, I want the ability to select one or more files or directories for encryption or decryption.
- As a user, I want to specify both the input and output file paths to control where the encrypted or decrypted files are stored.
#### Encryption Algorithms:
- As a security-conscious user, I want the script to support strong encryption algorithms like AES-256 for maximum security.
#### Password Protection:
- As a user, I want to set a strong password for encryption to ensure that only authorized individuals can decrypt the files.
- As a user, I want the script to prompt me for a password securely without displaying it on the screen.
#### File Integrity:
- As a user, I want to ensure that the decrypted file matches the original file's content to avoid data corruption.
